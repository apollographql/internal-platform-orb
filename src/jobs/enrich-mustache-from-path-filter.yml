  # meant to be a drop in replacement for path-filtering/filter
  # BUT: meant to be used in a situation where EITHER you
  # want an easy way to use the rest of this orb's enhance-mustache
  # functionality OR find that Circle's official path-filtering orb
  # doesn't work for your use case anymore.
  #
  # For exmaple, Circle's path-filtering works great if you want to turn on or off
  # currently defined workflows or part of a pipeline. But if you have
  # a situation where you want to create many instances of the SAME
  # jobs, this is much harder to keep DRY.
  #
  # In enrich-mustache-from-path-filter instead of passing parameters
  # via CircleCI continutation pipeline, it renders the specified Circle
  # pipeline as a mustache document. This Circle job was created to make the
  # path from path-filter
  #
  # Rules for parameters provided in the mappings section:
  #   1. these must be JSON literals
  #   2. If the JSON literal is an array [], if multiple matches are
  #      found then all the matched values will be concatinated in an array
  #   3. If a value is not marked as an array then subsequent sets will override
