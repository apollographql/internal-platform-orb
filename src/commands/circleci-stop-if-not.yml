  Helper command which, like circleci-stop-if will `halt` the entire execution of the running `job`, but does so if the value of
  `value` parameter is NOT the value of the `continue-if-value-is` parameter.

  Circle's "when" conditions are great, but you could use this as a pre-step in a workflow to avoid executing a job

parameters:
  value:
    type: string
    description: A value - maybe even a Circle parameter - to check
  continue-if-value-is:
    type: string
    description: If the value parameter matches this value, halt job execution. Job will still be green, but further steps will not happen

steps:
  - run:
      name: Halt if actual != expected
      command: |
        if [ ! "<< parameters.value >>" = "<< parameters.continue-if-value-is >>" ];
        then
          circleci-agent step halt
        fi
